c) 0(log n)

## Exercise II
We should be able to loop through each floor and toss and egg out at each one. Then we check if the egg is broken. Once we find one that is broken we check the next one below it (floor - 1) and check again, when it doesnt break we know everything above that floor will break it and every floor below will be ok to drop it from.
